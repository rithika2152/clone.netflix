# Netflix Clone using HTML and CSS

![Netflix Clone]

This project is a simple Netflix clone created using HTML and CSS, aimed at demonstrating the basic structure and design principles of the Netflix website. It is not a fully functional website and does not include any server-side functionalities or actual video streaming capabilities.

## Getting Started

To view this Netflix clone locally, simply follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file directly.
2. Navigate to the project's root folder.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
netflix-clone/
|-- index.html
|-- css/
|   |-- styles.css
|-- images/
|   |-- netflix-logo.png
|   |-- background.jpg
|   |-- movie1.jpg
|   |-- movie2.jpg
|   |-- ...
|-- README.md
```

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that represents the Netflix clone's homepage.
- `css/styles.css`: The CSS file that contains all the styles for the website.
- `images/`: A folder containing all the images used in the project.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.).
2. The homepage will display a list of movies, similar to Netflix's interface.
3. Click on any movie thumbnail to view more details (Note: This is a static representation and not real movie content).

## Customization

Feel free to customize this Netflix clone to add more features or improve the design. You can do the following:

- Add new movies to the list by modifying the `index.html` file.
- Change the styles by editing the `css/styles.css` file.
- Replace the movie images in the `images/` folder with your own movie thumbnails.
